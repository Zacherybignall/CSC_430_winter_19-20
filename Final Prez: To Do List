Problem statement
Old ER Diagram & Make New ER Diagram 
Enumerate & describe the integrity constraints 
Explain if BCNF was achieved with tables
Make a Trigger (if agreed price is 10000 less than sugested price? -idk making up something aka losing money)
Make a view (maybe use this to see if there is a problem aka loan_price = agreed_price) 
Update FD's and BCNF txt
What did everyone do?

update employee commision or fee, we have fee in FDs but not commision, and vice/versa in er, i think emp_commision 
should be in car sold since it has to do witht the price of the car, basically they get 20% of agreed prce or soemthing like that.
